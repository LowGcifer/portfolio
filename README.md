# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This simple portfolio contains a header with a title, as well as nav buttons to take you to certain parts of the website. The website is optimized for mobile use. The portfolio contains an image 
that increases in size when hovered only, indicating it is a link. It links to a very rudimentary and incomplete "first website" This is not meant to be a serious showcase of my skill, 
but is instead meant so that my portfolio isn't empty for the sake of the assignment.

An image is included in ./assets/Portfolio.jpg
